\title{priorDistribution}
\usage{
priorDistribution(transMatr, hyperparam = matrix())
}
\arguments{
\item{transMatr}{The transition matrix whose probability is the parameter of
interest.}

\item{hyperparam}{The hyperparam matrix (optional). If not provided, a
default value of 1 is assumed for each and therefore the resulting
probability distribution is uniform.}
}
\value{
The log of the probabilities for each state is returned in a numeric
  vector. Each number in the vector represents the probability (log) of
  having a probability transition vector as specified in corresponding the
  row of the transition matrix.
}
\description{
Function to evaluate the prior probability of a transition
  matrix. It is based on conjugate priors and therefore a Dirichlet
  distribution is used to model the transitions of each state.
}
\details{
The states (dimnames) of the transition matrix and the hyperparam
  may be in any order.
}
\note{
This function can be used in conjunction with inferHyperparam. For
  example, if the user has a prior data set and a prior transition matrix,
  he can infer the hyperparameters using inferHyperparam and then compute
  the probability of their prior matrix using the inferred hyperparameters
  with priorDistribution.

\examples{
priorDistribution(matrix(c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), 
                  nrow = 2, 
                  dimnames = list(c("a", "b"), c("a", "b"))), 
                  matrix(c(2, 2, 2, 2), 
                  nrow = 2, 
                  dimnames = list(c("a", "b"), c("a", "b"))))
