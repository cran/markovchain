\title{Various functions to perform statistical inference of DTMC}
\usage{
verifyMarkovProperty(sequence, verbose = TRUE)

assessOrder(sequence, verbose = TRUE)

assessStationarity(sequence, nblocks, verbose = TRUE)

verifyEmpiricalToTheoretical(data, object, verbose = TRUE)

verifyHomogeneity(inputList, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequence}{An empirical sequence.}

\item{verbose}{Should test results be printed out?}

\item{nblocks}{Number of blocks.}

\item{data}{matrix, character or list to be converted in a raw transition matrix}

\item{object}{a markovchain object}

\item{inputList}{A list of items that can coerced to transition matrices}
}
\value{
Verification result

a list with following slots: statistic (the chi - square statistic), dof (degrees of freedom), and corresponding p-value. In case a cell in the empirical transition matrix is >0
that is 0 in the theoretical transition matrix the null hypothesis is rejected. In that case a p-value of 0 and statistic and dof of NA are returned.

a list of transition matrices?
}
\description{
These functions verify the Markov property, assess 
             the order and stationarity of the Markov chain.

This function tests whether an empirical transition matrix is statistically compatible
with a theoretical one. It is a chi-square based test. In case a cell in the empirical transition matrix is >0
that is 0 in the theoretical transition matrix the null hypothesis is rejected.

Verifies that the s elements in the input list belongs to the same DTMC
