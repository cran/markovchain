\usage{
absorptionProbabilities(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{the markovchain object}
}
\value{
A named vector with the expected number of steps to go from a
  transient state to any of the recurrent ones
}
\description{
Computes the absorption probability from each transient
  state to each recurrent one (i.e. the (i, j) entry or (j, i), in a 
  stochastic matrix by columns, represents the probability that the
  first not transient state we can go from the transient state i is j
  (and therefore we are going to be absorbed in the communicating
  recurrent class of j)

m <- matrix(c(1/2, 1/2, 0,
