\title{Function to infer the hyperparameters for Bayesian inference from an a priori matrix or a data set}
\usage{
inferHyperparam(transMatr = matrix(), scale = numeric(),
  data = character())
}
\arguments{
\item{transMatr}{A valid transition matrix, with dimension names.}

\item{scale}{A vector of scaling factors, each element corresponds to the row names of the provided transition 
matrix transMatr, in the same order.}

\item{data}{A data set from which the hyperparameters are inferred.}
}
\value{
Returns the hyperparameter matrix in a list.
}
\description{
Since the Bayesian inference approach implemented in the package is based on conjugate priors, 
             hyperparameters must be provided to model the prior probability distribution of the chain 
             parameters. The hyperparameters are inferred from a given a priori matrix under the assumption 
             that the matrix provided corresponds to the mean (expected) values of the chain parameters. A 
             scaling factor vector must be provided too. Alternatively, the hyperparameters can be inferred 
             from a data set.
}
\details{
transMatr and scale need not be provided if data is provided.
}
\note{
The hyperparameter matrix returned is such that the row and column names are sorted alphanumerically, 
      and the elements in the matrix are correspondingly permuted.

\examples{
data(rain, package = "markovchain")
inferHyperparam(data = rain$rain)
 
weatherStates <- c("sunny", "cloudy", "rain")
weatherMatrix <- matrix(data = c(0.7, 0.2, 0.1, 
                                 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 
                                 0.2, 0.4, 0.4), 
                        byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3, 
                        dimnames = list(weatherStates, weatherStates))
inferHyperparam(transMatr = weatherMatrix, scale = c(10, 10, 10))
