-   2020-03-16 0.8.4Limiting output lines in vignettes.

-   2020-03-15 0.8.3 Add small changes in code to cope with upcoming R
    4.0.0 (stringsAsFactor=TRUE in data.frame).

-   2019-12-10 0.8.2 Add small changes in code to cope with upcoming R
    4.0.0 (no more check class(x)=='matrix') as well as packages'
    unavailable.

-   2019-08-13 0.7.0 Improves performance and refactors
    `communicatingClasses`, `recurrentClasses`, `transientStates`,
    `is.irreducible`, `canonicForm`, `summary` and `steadyStates`
    methods, porting them to C++ whenever possible and improving the
    algorithmic complexity of the code. Solves a bug with `steadyStates`
    method. Adds the methods `recurrentStates` and `transientClasses`.
    Makes the aforementioned methods work on by column Markov chains.
    Improves tests, adding checking of mathematical structural
    properties and hundreds of random test cases. Fixes documentation
    for `roxygen` and NAMESPACE file for automatic generation using
    `devtools::document()`
